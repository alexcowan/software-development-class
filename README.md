<h1>Software Development Class</h1>
<h2>Hi There</h2>
It's not too late to learn about coding! 

This is a short intro. class on design-driven software development. It's (very) roughly 60 hours of content, including class time and assignment time. It's designed for a learner that's comfortable with <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/best-agile-user-story/" target="blank">user stories</a> and related techniques on software design that I cover in this class: <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/software-design-class/" target="blank">Software Design</a>. That class is not a prerequisite, but if you haven't taken it you may need to budget a little extra time to loop back and cover a few key topics. 

After completing this course, students will be able to:
- Build functioning web applications using HTML, CSS, and Javascript 
- Focus coding tasks with user stories and prototypes 
- Evaluate alternative approaches to software implementations
- Participate in a version control process using Git and Github
- Work through technical issues with analytical debugging techniques

The material that follows is organized around 'sessions'. When I teach the class, there are 2 each week.

<h2>Session 1: Kickoff & Intro to HTML/CSS<h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
Introduce the class objectives and infrastructure. Start on HTML & CSS. 
<h3>Pre-Class Assignments</h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Do/Individual: Pick a Project & (Optional) Team</strong>
<br>WHAT? Pick a project and make sure you have at least:
<br>- <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/best-agile-user-story/" target="blank">User Stories</a> (epics and detail with child stories)
<br>- Prototype to articulate your user stories (<a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/build-your-first-prototype-in-30-minutes/" target="blank">Tutorial</a> 
<br>Being prepared with these items is important because one of the class' core objectives is learning to focus your work with stories. It's also important to have a pretty specific execution because when you're confronted with all the hooks and dials available to you, it helps to have a pre-existing idea of what you want to have happen.
