<h1>Software Development Class</h1>
<h2>Hi There</h2>
It's not too late to learn about coding! 

This is a short intro. class on design-driven software development. It's (very) roughly 60 hours of content, including class time and assignment time. It's designed for a learner that's comfortable with <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/best-agile-user-story/" target="blank">user stories</a> and related techniques on software design that I cover in this class: <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/software-design-class/" target="blank">Software Design</a>. That class is not a prerequisite, but if you haven't taken it you may need to budget a little extra time to loop back and cover a few key topics. 

<h2>Course Descriptions + Objectives</h2>
By the end of this class, you will have lost your fear of tinkering (with software). 

As an MBA considering roles like product manager, founder, or consultant, this is important. Between working software developer and knowing zero about coding, there’s a productive middle place. This is a place where you can:
follow discussions about software development
engage confidently in meaningful learning about the software/system you’re managing
create front-end prototypes

By the end of this class, you will be able to: 
Take user stories & prototype and translate render them into functioning web applications using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
Evaluate alternative approaches to software implementations
Work through software malfunctions with analytical debugging techniques

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
There are no course prerequisites and this course does not assume any prior programming experience. 

The course does require projects that have been through the <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/software-design-class/" target="blank">Software Design</a> class, <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/applied-innovation-silicon-valley/" target="blank">Applied Innovation class</a> , or a similar independent study. The input into this class is user stories and prototypes that have been through a substantial customer discovery and design process- something like the <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/venture-design/" target="blank">Venture Design</a> process we use in the aforementioned class. 

<h2>Teams + Projects</h2>
While the assignments are a mix of individual and team assignments, students will work in teams of 2 (min) to 4 (max) individuals. Students can organize around student-submitted projects with the prerequisites above. Student projects must be accepted in advance or by the first week of class.

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
Your primary deliverable is working software and a portfolio entry about what you built and why. The software application platform is Wordpress. You can do the portfolio entry wherever you like, though I recommend Behance. 

You’ll spend a lot of your class hours learning how to make stuff work. That’s normal, and it’s necessary, but the core objective is for you to understand what it takes to move from design narrative to working software. For this reason, we intersperse the class with sessions on peer review and discussion about your implementation. It’s also why your portfolio entry is a significant part of your grade.

The material below is organized around 'sessions' of roughly 90 minutes/each.

<h2>Grading</h2>

Category | Due Date | Percent of Final Grade
------------ | ------------- |  -------------
Attendance, Participation, & Peer Reviews | Every day/ongoing | 30
Completion of Individual Assignments | (as stated on Canvas) | 30
Team Project- Working Software | Exam period | 25
Team Project- Portfolio Entry | Exam period | 15

**Attendance, Participation, & Peer Reviews: 30%**
My objective is to provide a stimulating environment for you to learn the process of software development. This portion of your grade includes the following: 
being prepared for class (assignments, background work on CodeAcademy)
on-time attendance
participating in classroom exercises and discussions
posting questions, responses, and ideas to the forum (on Piazza) 

I expect you to inform me before class if you will be missing.  Absences for reasons other than illness for which I do not receive prior notice will count against your class participation grade. 

Since this class is fundamentally experiential and about doing (vs. just discussing), your work in peer review is an important part of your learning experience and grade. You will each have an assigned peer from outside your team and your peer review notes are a part of this portion of your grade. 

**Completion of Individual Assignments: 30%**
This includes on-time completion of the CodeAcademy lessons as well as related assignments on your project (submitted via Canvas). 

**Team Project- Working Software: 25%**
This is your final team deliverable in the form of working software on your WordPress site. 

**Team Project- Portfolio Entry: 25%**
This is your team explanation of what you did and why in the form of a portfolio entry on Behance or a similar platform.

<h2>Session 1: Kickoff & Intro to HTML+CSS<h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
Introduce the class objectives and infrastructure. Start on HTML & CSS. 
<h3>Pre-Class Assignments</h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Do/Individual: Pick a Project & (Optional) Team and Prepare Your Design</strong>
<br>WHAT? Pick a project and make sure you have at least:
<br>- <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/best-agile-user-story/" target="blank">User Stories</a> (epics and detail with child stories)
<br>- Prototype to articulate your user stories (<a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/build-your-first-prototype-in-30-minutes/" target="blank">Tutorial</a>) 
<br>Being prepared with these items is important because one of the class' core objectives is learning to focus your work with stories. It's also important to have a pretty specific execution because when you're confronted with all the hooks and dials available to you, it helps to have a pre-existing idea of what you want to have happen.
