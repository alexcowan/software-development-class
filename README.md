<h1>Software Development Class</h1>
<h2>Hi There</h2>
It's not too late to learn about coding! 

This is a short intro. class on design-driven software development for the MBA/businessperson. When I teach it at UVA Darden, it's (very) roughly 40 hours of content, including class time and assignment time. It's designed for a learner that's comfortable with the basics of software design, including <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/best-agile-user-story/" target="blank">user stories</a> and related techniques on software design that I cover in this class: <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/software-design-class/" target="blank">Software Design</a>. That class is not a prerequisite, but if you haven't taken it you may need to budget a little extra time to loop back and cover a few key topics. 

<h2>Course Descriptions + Objectives</h2>
By the end of this class, you will have lost your fear of tinkering (with software). You'll also have a hands-on introduction to how modern software design relates to actual development.  

As an MBA considering roles like product manager, founder, or consultant, this is important. Between working software developer and knowing zero about coding, there’s a productive middle place. This is a place where you can:
- follow discussions about software development
- engage confidently in meaningful learning about the software/system you’re managing
- create front-end prototypes

By the end of this class, you will be able to: 
1. Take user stories & prototype and translate render them into functioning web applications using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
2. Evaluate alternative approaches to software implementations
3. Work through software malfunctions with analytical debugging techniques

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
There are no course prerequisites and this course does not assume any prior programming experience. 

The course does require projects that have been through the <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/software-design-class/" target="blank">Software Design</a> class, <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/applied-innovation-silicon-valley/" target="blank">Applied Innovation class</a> , or a similar independent study. The input into this class is user stories and prototypes that have been through a substantial customer discovery and design process- something like the <a href="http://www.alexandercowan.com/venture-design/" target="blank">Venture Design</a> process we use in the aforementioned class. A suitable design would have most of the elements you see in this <a href="http://ref.alexandercowan.com/pdesign" target="blank">Venture Design template</a>

<h2>Teams + Projects</h2>
While the assignments are a mix of individual and team assignments, students will work in teams of 2 (min) to 4 (max) individuals. Students can organize around student-submitted projects with the prerequisites above. Student projects must be accepted in advance or by the first class session.

<h2>Course Structure</h2>
Your primary deliverable is working software and a <a href="https://www.alexandercowan.com/creating-personal-innovation-portfolio/#Application_Development" target="blank">portfolio entry</a> about what you built and why. The software application platform is Wordpress. 

You’ll spend a lot of your class hours learning how to make stuff work. That’s normal, and it’s necessary, but the core objective is for you to understand what it takes to move from design narrative to working software. For this reason, we intersperse the class with sessions on peer review and discussion about your implementation. It’s also why your portfolio entry is a significant part of your grade.

The material below is organized around 'sessions' of roughly 90 minutes/each.

<h2>Grading</h2>

Category | Due Date | Percent of Final Grade
------------ | ------------- |  -------------
Attendance & Participation | Every day/ongoing | 50
Team Project- Working Software | Exam period | 35
Team Project- Portfolio Entry | Exam period | 15

**Attendance & Participation: 30%**
My objective is to provide a stimulating environment for you to learn the process of software development. This portion of your grade includes the following: 
being prepared for class: understand the topics at hand and being able to discuss your work and your team's work
on-time, full attendance
posting questions, responses, and ideas to the forum (on Piazza) 

I expect you to inform me before class if you will be missing.  Absences for reasons other than illness for which I do not receive prior notice will count against your class participation grade. 

**Team Project- Working Software: 35%**
This is your final team deliverable in the form of working software on your WordPress site. 

**Team Project- Portfolio Entry: 25%**
This is your team explanation of what you did and why in the form of a portfolio entry on Behance.

<h2>Where Things Are</h2>
The following table describes the location of resources for the class.

<h2>Session 1:Introduction to HTML</h2>
Objective: Achieve basic working proficiency with HTML.<br/>
Case: <a href="https://www.alexandercowan.com/from-prototype-to-html/" target="blank">From Prototype to HTML</a><br/>
Supplemental Materials: <br/>
Written Tutorial- <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp" target="blank">HTML Introduction</a> <br/>
or for more depth and structure<br/>
Online Course- <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-html-elements/lessons/intro-to-html/" target="blank">Learn HTML</a> (I would stick to just the first module ‘HTML Elements and Structure’ and (unless you’re interested) skip the module on tables, ‘HTML Tables’)
<h3>Assignment</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Read the <a href="https://www.alexandercowan.com/from-prototype-to-html/" target="blank">case</a>. Looking at the sample code on JS Fiddle, can you identify all the HTML elements? Can you explain their roles? Suppose you wanted to create rounded corners on the div elements with a solid border? How would you do that? What else do you think is worth trying? Try it out!</li>
	<li>In order to have something you can show and discuss in class, you'll need to fork the JS Fiddle and save your edits</li>
</ol>
Notes: 
In class, we'll step through the elements of the page and edit them based on ideas for moving it forward. Doing Google searches like 'create round border on a div' is a great way to learn and get comfortable working through implementations.
